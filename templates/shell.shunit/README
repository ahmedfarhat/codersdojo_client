These files were created:
  README is what you are currently reading
  run-once.%sh% runs your tests once
  run-endless.%sh% runs your tests endlessly via run-once.%sh%

Run run-endless.%sh% and start your kata. (On Mac/Linux you have to call ./run-endless.%sh%.)

Assumptions:
  - The whole kata source code is in the one %kata_file%.sh.
  - shunit2 is in your path.

The support for Shell/ShUnit was contributed by Stefan Roock (Twitter: StefanRoock, http://stefanroock.de).
