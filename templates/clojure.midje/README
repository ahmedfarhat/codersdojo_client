These files were created:
  README is what you are currently reading
  run-once.%sh% runs your tests once
  run-endless.%sh% runs your tests endlessly via run-once.%sh%

Run run-endless.%sh% and start your kata. (On Mac/Linux you have to call ./run-endless.%sh%.)

Assumptions:
  - Java is installed on your system and 'java' is in the path.
  - clojure.jar, clojure-contrib.jar, midje.jar and unifycle.jar are placed in the 'lib' directory.

The support for Clojure/Midje was contributed by Stefan Roock.
