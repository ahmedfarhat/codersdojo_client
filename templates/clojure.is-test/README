Two shell scripts were created:
  run-once.%sh% runs your tests once
  run-endless.%sh% runs your tests endlessly via run-once.%sh%

Run run-endless.sh and start your kata.

Assumptions:
  - The whole kata source code is in the one %kata_file%.clj.
  - Java is installed on your system and 'java' is in the path.
  - clojure.jar and clojure-contrib.jar are placed in the 'lib' directory.
