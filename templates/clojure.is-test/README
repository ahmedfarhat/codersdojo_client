You have to create two shell scripts manually:
  Create a shell script run-once.%sh% with this content:
    java -cp clojure-contrib.jar%:%clojure.jar clojure.main #{kata_file}.clj

  Create a second shell script run-endless.sh with this content:
    #{$0} start run-once.%sh% #{kata_file}.clj

Run run-endless.%sh% and start your kata.

Assumptions:
  - Java is installed on your system and 'java' is in the path.
  - clojure.jar and clojure-contrib.jar are placed in your work directory.
