These files were created:
  README is what you are currently reading
  run-once.%sh% runs your tests once
  run-endless.%sh% runs your tests endlessly via run-once.%sh%

Run run-endless.%sh% and start your kata. (On Mac/Linux you have to call ./run-endless.%sh%.)

Assumptions:
  - The MonoDevelop framework is installed.
  - nunit.framework.dll is in the same directory as %Kata_file%.cs.
  - The whole kata source code is in the one %Kata_file%.cs.

The support for C#/NUnit was contributed by Meike Mertsch (Twitter: meikemertsch).
