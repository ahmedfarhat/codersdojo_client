You have to create two shell scripts manually:
  Create a shell script run-once.%sh% that runs the tests of your kata once.

  Create a second shell script run-endless.sh with this content:
    #{$0} start run-once.%sh% #{kata_file}.<extension>

Run run-endless.%sh% and start your kata.

Assumptions:
  - The whole kata source code is in the one #{kata_file}.<extension>.
