These files were created:
  README is what you are currently reading
  run-once.%sh% runs your tests once
  run-endless.%sh% runs your tests endlessly via run-once.%sh%

run-once.%sh% is not implemented by now. You have to implement it appropriately. The return code of the script has to be 0 if the tests succeeded and another value if the tests failed.

Run run-endless.%sh% and start your kata. (On Mac/Linux you have to call ./run-endless.%sh%.)

Assumptions:
  - The whole kata source code is in the one %kata_file.ext%.
