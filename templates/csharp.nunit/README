Two shell scripts were created:
  run-once.%sh% runs your tests once
  run-endless.%sh% runs your tests endlessly via run-once.%sh%

Run run-endless.%sh% and start your kata.

Assumptions:
  - The .Net Framework is installed (from www.microsoft.com).
  - in the Path variable:
      csc              (possible path=C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\)
      nunit-console    (possible path=C:\Programme\NUnit 2.5.9\bin\net-2.0\)
  - nunit.framework.dll is in the same directory as %kata_file%.cs.
  - The whole kata source code is in the one %kata_file%.cs.
