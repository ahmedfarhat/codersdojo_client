You have to create two shell scripts manually:
  Create a shell script run-once.%sh% with this content:
    %rm% bin/#{kata_file}.class
    javac -cp lib/junit.jar -d bin #{kata_file}.java
    java -cp lib/junit.jar%:%bin #{kata_file}

  Create a second shell script run-endless.sh with this content:
    #{$0} start run-once.%sh% src/#{kata_file}.java

Run run-endless.%sh% and start your kata.

Assumptions:
  - A Java JDK is installed on your system and 'java' and 'javac' are in the path.
  - junit.jar is placed in a directory named 'lib'.
  - The kata source file is placed in the 'src' directory.
  - The kata class file is generated into the 'class' directory.
  - In the source file the classes are placed in the default package.
  - The kata source file has a main method that starts the tests.
  - If your IDE (like Eclipse) compiles the source file, you should remove the first two lines
    in the run-once.%sh% file.
