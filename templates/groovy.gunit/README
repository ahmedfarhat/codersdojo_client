These files were created:
  README is what you are currently reading
  run-once.%sh% runs your tests once
  run-endless.%sh% runs your tests endlessly via run-once.%sh%

Run run-endless.%sh% and start your kata. (On Mac/Linux you have to call ./run-endless.sh.)

Assumptions:
  - Java and Groovy is installed on your system, 'groovy' is in the path and GROOVY_HOME is set.
  - groovy.jar is placed in the 'lib' directory.
  - The whole kata source code is in the one %Kata_file%Test.groovy.

The support for Groovy/GUnit was contributed by Stefan Roock.
