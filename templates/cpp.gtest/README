These files were created:
  README is what you are currently reading
  run-once.sh runs your tests once
  run-endless.sh runs your tests endlessly via run-once.sh

Run run-endless.sh and start your kata. (On Mac/Linux you have to call ./run-endless.sh.)

Assumptions:
  - make and a C++ compiler (like gcc) is installed on your system and is in the PATH
  - The whole kata source code is in the one %Kata_file%.cc.
  - The GTest framework is in the directory gtest.
  - If your IDE does the compilation and linking, you should remove the first 3 lines
    in the run-once.%sh% file.
